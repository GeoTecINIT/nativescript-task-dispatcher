# nativescript-task-dispatcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher.svg?token=cYMN5eetmCX8aPqFVaQb&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher)

NativeScript Task Dispatcher is a NativeScript plugin aimed to ease the execution of mobile app's task definition and execution workflows in the background, regardless of wether the app is visible to the user or not.

It abstracts all the platform-specific details, leaving a clear and easy-to-use, yet powerful, API for task development and the definition of dependencies between them by means of an event-driven software architecture.

This plugin uses native mechanisms to carry out its function. All the code is executed in the main thread, we don't use web workers. It is not intended to free the main thread from intensive workloads, but rather to allow tasks to be performed while the user is not actively using the application.

## How it works?

This plugin bases its way of working in three software primitives:

- **Tasks:** Small pieces of software meant to do only one job. Examples of tasks are:
  - A software fragment in charge of reading data from a sensor (e.g. user location).
  - Another code fragment in charge of doing some processing with the collected measurement (e.g. calculate the distance to a concrete venue).
  - Also user-visible actions, like a code snippet in charge of regularly delivering a notification to the user informing about the distance to the venue.
- **Task graph:** A semantic way of describing how tasks relate to each other. Which tasks depend on an external event (an event not generated by a task) being triggered or in the output (in form of an event) of another tasks. Also which tasks are triggered by time events like:
  - At a certain time
  - In a certain amount of minutes
  - In a recurrent interval
  - At a certain time and in a specified recurrent interval since that time
- **Task schedulers:** These are completely transparent to the user of the plugin, right now there are two schedulers and another three planned:
  - _Immediate tasks scheduler (Android/iOS):_ in charge of running tasks that have to run a task immediately, with zero delay. This scheduler is in charge of running tasks whose execution has been triggered by another task.
  - _> 1 minute tasks scheduler (Android only):_ An alarm-based task scheduler. In charge of running tasks whose execution window falls in a minute or more in the future.
  - _**(Planned)** < 1 minute tasks scheduler (Android only):_ A background service-based tasks scheduler. That will be in charge of running time-critical tasks that need to run bellow a 1 minute period (e.g. tasks running every 15 seconds)
  - _**(Planned)** Delayed tasks scheduler (iOS only):_ Will allow running time-triggered tasks in iOS. We cannot make any promises about its time accuracy or its possibilities. We are still studying how to implement this (**PRs are welcome!**)
  - _**(Planned)** Event-driven tasks scheduler (Android/iOS):_ Two implementations, identical functionality. Will reliably run tasks triggered by external events in the background (e.g. a change in the activity of the user, a server-sent event, a system event, etc.). A basic multi-platform version of this scheduler is already running but can only execute tasks reliably when the app is visible to the user or another scheduler is already running.

To illustrate how the three aforementioned components link together, let's present the following simple (yet relatively complex) use case. Let's say that we want to wake-up our app every minute. To run a dummy task, collect the battery level of the device and log the task execution. In parallel, we want to follow the same workflow but with a task that collects user location, another task which collects battery level and finally another tasks that logs the execution of the whole pipeline branch. The following figure depicts the whole process:

![](./img/alarm-scheduler-lifecycle.png)

Here **_> 1 minute tasks scheduler_** and **_Immediate tasks scheduler_** take place. The first scheduler bootstraps both task chains every minute, running them in parallel and waiting for them to finish before putting the device again to sleep. The task which logs the execution of a task chain depends on the battery (%) collection task successfully finishing in order to run. At the same time, battery level collection task won't run if the dummy task or the GPS task don't run before.

## Prerequisites

### Android

Plugin supports devices running Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (SDK 17) to Android 10 Q (SDK 29). Given that this plugin supports last Android 10 changes in foreground services, **Android Build Tools 29.x.x+ is required**.

### iOS

**This plugin does not support iOS at its full extent**. In order to enable iOS support, this plugin requires a mechanism able to schedule tasks in time. We are evaluating how to do that, but cannot make any promises about when this functionality will be available. Sadly, it is not our priority to give a solution to this soon, but PRs are welcome in order to address this shortcoming.

## Installation

Run the following command in your project's root folder:

```javascript
tns plugin add nativescript-task-dispatcher
```

### Android-specific steps

#### Running tasks in foreground

If one or more of your app tasks require to run in foreground (while in background), for example if one of your tasks requires to access user location on a regular basis (more than once per hour) while in background ([more info here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background-location-limits)), please ensure the following keys are included in your app's `strings.xml` file (located in: `App_Resources -> Android -> src -> main -> res -> values`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
  <!--> Other strings <-->

  <!-->
    The notification channel used in Android 8.0 and upper to deliver foreground service sticky notifications.
    (more info here: https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels)
  <-->
  <string name="task_dispatcher_location_usage_channel_name">"Background location"</string>
  <string name="task_dispatcher_location_usage_channel_description">"Indicates when the app is accessing your location in background"</string>
  <!-->
    The notification title and content that your user will see in the status bar while the service is running in foreground.
    (more info here: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services#Foreground)
  <-->
  <string name="task_dispatcher_location_usage_notification_title">"demo app is using your location"</string>
  <string name="task_dispatcher_location_usage_notification_content">""</string>

  <!--> Other strings <-->
</resources>
```

#### Want to run tasks at intervals below _15 minutes_? See here

This plugin has been highly optimized to get over one of the biggest shortcomings in Android, **running tasks reliably at < 15 minutes intervals** (and >= 1 minute) without resorting to always running battery-consuming background services.

In order to do so, first you'll have to check if you meet one of the requirements to be whitelisted by the OS as an app that does not have to be bothered by the system's energy optimizer: [https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#whitelisting-cases](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#whitelisting-cases)

If your meets the requirements to be whitelisted, then you'll need to add the following permission in your app's AndroidManifest.xml file (located in: `App_Resources -> Android -> src -> main`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
	package="__PACKAGE__" ...>

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS"/>

</manifest>
```

We'll handle the rest for you :)

> **Disclaimer**: Google regularly checks its store for apps that have declared the indicated permission. If you claim that your app should be whitelisted but in the end it turns out not, your app could end up banned from the Play Store. We advise you to thoroughly evaluate this.

## Usage

### Quick start

First of all you'll need to start defining some tasks and make them globally accessible. As a matter of an example, here you can see some tasks that we have defined for our demo app (located in: `demo/app/tasks/index.ts`):

```ts
// tasks.ts;
import { Task, SimpleTask } from "nativescript-task-dispatcher/tasks";
import { toSeconds } from "nativescript-task-dispatcher/utils/time-converter";

export const appTasks: Array<Task> = [
  // The "hello world" of the tasks
  new SimpleTask("fastTask", async ({ log }) => log("Fast task run!")),
  // A task which takes 2 seconds to complete
  new SimpleTask(
    "mediumTask",
    ({ log, onCancel }) =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
          log("Medium task run!");
          resolve();
        }, 2000);
        onCancel(() => {
          clearTimeout(timeoutId);
          resolve();
        });
      })
  ),
  // A really slow task, which takes 30 seconds to complete
  new SimpleTask(
    "slowTask",
    ({ log, onCancel }) =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
          log("Slow task run!");
          resolve();
        }, 30000);
        onCancel(() => {
          clearTimeout(timeoutId);
          resolve();
        });
      }),
    // Simulate that this task requires a visible UI element in order to run without problems (a foreground service with sticky notification in Android)
    { foreground: true }
  ),

  // A task meant to be run repeatedly at different rates
  // (always incrementing in 1 the number of minutes between executions).
  // This can be taken as an starting point for retry strategies.
  new SimpleTask("incrementalTask", async ({ params, log, runAgainIn }) => {
    const execCount = params.execCount ? params.execCount : 1;
    const execTime = toSeconds(execCount, "minutes");

    log(`Incremental task: Task run after ${execTime} seconds`);

    runAgainIn(toSeconds(execCount + 1, "minutes"), {
      execCount: execCount + 1,
    });
  }),
];
```

Explanation of the example tasks:

- **fastTask:** A task that just runs. The "hello world" of the tasks. It has zero temporal cost and complexity. Runs and logs something.
- **mediumTask:** An example of a task which takes a barely small amount of time to do some work. It uses NativeScript `setTimeout()` proxy to simulate that the task is running for 2 seconds.
- **slowTask:** An example of a task which takes a life to complete. It simulates a slow behavior, like when the location provider is taking more time than usual to get a coordinate fix. Aside from this, this task also declares that requires a foreground execution context in order to run without issues.
- **incrementalTask:** A task meant to accumulatively delay its execution after each run.

Next you will need a way to describe how all the defined tasks work together. In order to do so, you will have to define your app's task graph. Again, as a mater of an example, we have created an example task graph in the demo application for you (located in: `demo/app/tasks/graph.ts`):

```ts
// graph.ts;
import {
  TaskGraph,
  EventListenerGenerator,
  RunnableTaskDescriptor,
} from "nativescript-task-dispatcher/tasks/graph";

class DemoTaskGraph implements TaskGraph {
  async describe(
    on: EventListenerGenerator,
    run: RunnableTaskDescriptor
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Time triggered tasks
    on("startEvent", run("fastTask").every(1, "minutes").cancelOn("stopEvent"));
    on(
      "startEvent",
      run("mediumTask").every(2, "minutes").cancelOn("stopEvent")
    );
    on("startEvent", run("slowTask").every(4, "minutes").cancelOn("stopEvent"));

    // Event-driven tasks
    on("slowTaskFinished", run("mediumTask"));
    on("mediumTaskFinished", run("fastTask"));

    // Example about how to run incrementalTask
    // on("startEvent", run("incrementalTask").in(1, "minutes"));
  }
}

export const demoTaskGraph = new DemoTaskGraph();
```

Explanation of the task graph:

- _By time the external event "startEvent" gets triggered_ 3 task instances are scheduled to run:
  - **fastTask** every minute
  - **mediumTask** every two minutes
  - **slowTask** every four minutes
- _After 1 minute_ **fastTask** runs immediately and logs its message through the console
- _After 2 minutes_ **fast and medium tasks** run. **fastTask** runs immediately, **mediumTask** takes 2 seconds to run. After **mediumTask** finishes, **fastTask** runs again. Then, the device goes to sleep.
- _After 3 minutes_ **fastTask** runs again
- _After 4 minutes_ **fast, medium and slow tasks** run. **fastTask** runs immediately, **mediumTask** takes 2 seconds to run and **slowTask** takes 30 seconds to run. After **mediumTask** finishes, **fastTask** runs again. After **slowTask** finishes, **mediumTask** runs again and takes 2 seconds to run, after those 2 seconds, **fastTask** runs for a third time in this task chain. Then, the device goes to sleep.
- And so on, _until external event "stopEvent" gets triggered_. By this time, all scheduled tasks get cancelled and no task runs from here, due the event driven nature of the task graph.

As you can see, task graphs can get as complicated as you want (or need, for your application). There are some [limitations](#limitations) though.

> **Note**: By default all the tasks produce an event with the format: `{task-name}finished` upon completion. This behavior can be overridden in order to generate custom events.

The next thing to do is to initialize task's dispatcher object globally passing by the previously-defined app tasks and task graph. You will have to do that in app's `app.ts` file (or `main.ts` file in an Angular application):

```ts
// app.ts / main.ts
// TypeScript App:
import * as app from "tns-core-modules/application";
// or Angular App:
import { platformNativeScriptDynamic } from "nativescript-angular/platform";
import { AppModule } from "./app/app.module";

// NativeScript Task Dispatcher plugin imports
// (always between imports and app initialization)
import { taskDispatcher } from "nativescript-task-dispatcher";
import { appTasks } from "./tasks";
import { demoTaskGraph } from "./tasks/graph";

taskDispatcher.init(appTasks, demoTaskGraph, {
  // Recommended, to see debug and info messages while developing
  enableLogging: true,
});

// TypeScript App:
app.run({ moduleName: "app-root" });
// Angular App:
platformNativeScriptDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

Finally, you'll need to decide where does your app generate the external event that starts your task graph. As a matter of an example, in our demo app it is placed inside `home-page.ts` (home page's controller). We emit the `"startEvent"` when the user navigates to this view:

```ts
// home-page.ts
import { taskDispatcher } from "nativescript-task-dispatcher";
import { emit, createEvent } from "nativescript-task-dispatcher/events";

import { NavigatedData, Page } from "tns-core-modules/ui/page";
import { HomeViewModel } from "./home-view-model";

export function onNavigatingTo(args: NavigatedData) {
  const page = <Page>args.object;

  page.bindingContext = new HomeViewModel();

  emitStartEvent();
}

async function emitStartEvent() {
  const isReady = await taskDispatcher.isReady();
  if (!isReady) {
    await taskDispatcher.prepare();
  }
  emit(createEvent("startEvent"));
}
```

## API

### taskDispatcher - Methods

Plugin's entry point. A singleton instance that can be used as needed throughout your app.

| Name                                                                          | Return type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `init(appTasks: Array<Task>, appTaskGraph: TaskGraph, config?: ConfigParams)` | `Promise<void>`    | Allows to initialize the plugin with your own custom tasks and a task graph to describe how do they relate to each other. In order for the plugin to work, **it must be called only once** at your app's entry point (`app.ts` or `main.ts`). Through the configuration you can enable library's info and debug logging and also inject your custom logger which will inherently enable library's logging.                                                                                           |
| `isReady()`                                                                   | `Promise<boolean>` | Allows to check (and wait for) plugin initialization status. It also iterates over your app's tasks to check if they are [ready](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/task.ts#L114) for its execution. You should call this method before emitting any external event. The promise is stored internally, it is safe to call this method as many times as needed.                                                                                |
| `prepare()`                                                                   | `Promise<void>`    | Method to be called if isReady() returns false. If your app has one or more tasks that have reported not to be ready, it will call their [prepare()](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/task.ts#L122) method (e.g. to ask for missing permissions or enable disabled capabilities). **WARNING! This method is only meant to be called while the UI is visible.** Follow this guideline to foster the creation of a consistent task ecosystem. |

### Task ([see code](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/task.ts#L10))

A low level construct that allows the definition of code fragments meant to be executed independently from your app's view. It is an abstract class, which means that it is not meant for being instantiated, but to be extended instead. It is a powerful yet complex class and because of that we recommend you to use [SimpleTask](#simpletask-see-code) class instead for simpler operations (as its name implies).

There is an scenario where extending the Task class makes more sense than using a SimpleTask. If your task requires of certain conditions to be met in order to successfully run, you should create a new class that inherits from the Task class and override certain methods as follows:

```ts
// data-provider-task.ts
import { Task, TaskConfig } from "nativescript-task-dispatcher/tasks";

export class DataProviderTask extends Task {
  constructor(
    name: string,
    // Inject task dependencies here. e.g.:
    // private dataProvider: DataProvider
    taskConfig?: TaskConfig
  ) {
    super(name, taskConfig);
  }

  async checkIfCanRun(): Promise<void> {
    // e.g.:
    // await this.dataProvider.checkIfAppHasPermission();
  }

  async prepare(): Promise<void> {
    // e.g.:
    // await this.dataProvider.askPermission();
  }

  protected async onRun(): Promise<void> {
    // Here you can access some contextual information
    // like this.taskParams
    // and this.invocationEvent
    // more info at Task class API section

    let data = {};
    // e.g:
    this.setCancelFunction(() => {
      // Gracefully stop data acquisition if task gets cancelled. e.g.:
      //this.dataProvider.stopDataAcquisition();
    });
    // data = await this.dataProvider.acquireData();

    // Mark the task execution as finished and emit a custom event (dataAcquired)
    // with the acquired data as payload to make it accessible to any tasks
    // waiting for this task to complete
    this.done(`dataAcquired`, { data });
  }
}
```

#### Methods to override when extending Task class

| `constructor(name: string, taskConfig?: TaskConfig)` | `void`             | Override task constructor to inject external dependencies or to perform actions at instantiation time.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `onRun()`                                            | `Promise<void>`    | Override this method to describe your task's logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (optional) `checkIfCanRun()`                         | `Promise<boolean>` | Override this method if your task cannot if some conditions are not met. This method will be called while calling taskDispatcher.isReady() method. As an example, you can perform permission checks here.                                                            |
| (optional) `prepare()`                               | `Promise<boolean>` | Override this method to define all the actions that must be executed in order to allow your task to run without issues. **UI code is allowed!** As an example, you can ask for permissions here. The UI is supposed to be visible by the time this method is called. |

> **Note:** We highly discourage you to **not to override other Task class methods** aside of the listed in the table above. _Things could go really wrong._

| `setCancelFunction(f: () => void)`                      | `void`      | Because of OS restrictions your task could end up being stopped at some moment if it takes too long to execute. Use this method to pass by a function to define actions to be performed in case your task has to finish its execution earlier than expected. You can cancel requests here or save partial results to start from the saved progress when the task gets invoked again.                                     |
| `done(eventName: string, data?: { [key: string]: any})` | `void`      | Use this method if your task has some results to report to other tasks upon finalization. If you forget to call this function, the plugin will emit an event with the following shape: `{your-task-name}Finished`. This allows the device to go to sleep when unattended tasks finish their execution.                                                                                                                   |

If you set a custom [Logger](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/utils/logger/common.ts#L1) at plugin's initialization time, all log() method calls will pass through your logger as info messages. |

### SimpleTask ([see code](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/simple-task.ts#L6))

A higher level (and simpler) version of the [Task](#task-see-code) construct. It enforces functional programming principles to declare tasks as functions within a class object container. All the interaction with the simple task is done through its constructor. The constructor has the following shape:

> [SimpleTask](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/simple-task.ts#L6)(name: string, functionToRun: [SimpleTaskFunction](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/simple-task.ts#L4), taskConfig?: [TaskConfig](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/simple-task.ts#L4))

The function passed by to the SimpleTask constructor only gets a context parameter, which is a JavaScript object with the following properties:

| Name                                                    | Type                                                                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Due to context parameter being an object you can use JavaScript's [object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Operadores/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring) mechanism while developing your own tasks to only use the properties that you need. In the following example you can see how all the context properties of the context object can be extracted by using this technique:

```ts
import { Task, SimpleTask } from "nativescript-task-dispatcher/tasks";

export const appTasks: Array<Task> = [
  new SimpleTask("myCustomTask", async ({ log }) => {
    log("I only need to print something, why bother me with other things?");
  }),

  new SimpleTask(
    "useThemAllTask",
    async ({ params, evt, log, onCancel, runAgainIn, done }) => {
      log(`Started running with params=${params}, invokedBy evt=${evt}`);
      onCancel(() => {
        log("Can't stop me now");

        // Remember, we advise you not to use the following function in recurrent tasks
        // (unless you add some mechanism to control the recursive storm)
        runAgainIn(60, { state: "Some random state" });
      });
      done("mrIllUseThemAllHasFinished(thankfully)", {
        message: "But i'll return",
      });
    },
    { outputEventNames: ["mrIllUseThemAllHasFinished(thankfully)"] }
  ),
];
```

### TaskGraph ([see code](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/graph/index.ts#L16))

The TaskGraph allows you to describe how your tasks interact between them and as a response to time and external events. Plugin's TaskGraph is an interface, this means that you have total freedom to implement your own class adhering to it or integrate it inside an existing class.

Currently the task graph interface only has one method:

> describe(on: [EventListenerGenerator](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/graph/index.ts#L7), run: [RunnableTaskDescriptor](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/graph/index.ts#L11)): `Promise<void>`

Notice that the describe method expects your implementation to return a promise. This means that you could eventually load your task graph from an external source (like a file or a database). This gives the developer a lot of freedom when describing how task interact.

The complexity here relapses in the the two parameters that the describe method receives. The EventListenerGenerator (`on`) is a function which receives two arguments a string with the name of the event that initiates an action and the receiver of that action, which right now can only be a ReadyRunnableTaskBuilder.

The only (advised) way to create a ReadyRunnableTaskBuilder from within a TaskGraph is by using describe's second parameter: `run`, a RunnableTaskDescriptor. The RunnableTaskDescriptor is another function which takes as arguments, the name of the task to be run and the parameters that are going to be passed to this task at runtime ([TaskParams](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/tasks/task.ts#L237)). `run` returns a RunnableTaskBuilder with the following methods:

| Name                                        | Return type                                                                                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Events

In order to interact with the plugin from any point of your app we offer two methods to create and emit events.

> [createEvent](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/events/events.ts#L20)(name: string, params: [CreateEventParams](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/events/events.ts#L34)): [DispatchableEvent](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/events/events.ts#L34)

The id contained in event params is heavily use through the plugin to track event chains. When not provided, the plugin creates one. Only overwrite it when the event to be emitted results from another event.

> [emit](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/events/events.ts#L34)(dispatchableEvent: [DispatchableEvent](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher/blob/master/src/internal/events/events.ts#L34)): void

Emit an event created by `createEvent`.

> **Note:** This last part of the API could probably change in the future to support bootstrapping task chains from anywhere. Stay tunned to future changes before updating to a newer version of the plugin.

## Limitations

- **No support for scheduled tasks on iOS**. We currently cannot commit to an estimated time until this limitation gets addressed.
- **Scheduled tasks can run in parallel, in contrast _an event cannot spawn the execution of multiple tasks at the same time._** We are aware of that this might pose severe constraints for certain setups. That's why solving this limitation is one of our priorities
- **Task chains initiated by external events might not be able to finish its execution at some point if the user switches to a different app or the task chain starts in background.** Again, we are aware of that this can pose a problem for executing tasks reliably under certain circumstances. That's why solving this limitation is another of our priorities.
- **Trying to stop and start scheduled tasks in the same app run will lead to latest planning being ignored**. This was thought as a feature to avoid event-driven tasks being triggered after its cancellation, but we can understand that it can be understood as a bug. We'll fix this limitation by following a different convention: in order to stop an event-driven task, stop the event source instead. Addressing this limitation is our top priority.
